# Sure-Bet

Leveraging Maching Learning & AWS to help you win your fantasy football league.

## About the Project  

With the NFL season officially starting 8 September, we anticipate that at least a few of our classmates and/or colleagues are participating in Fantasy Football, either in a traditional league, daily fantasy, weekly pick'em contests, etc.  As a point of reference it is estimated that Fantasy Football is a $18.6 Billion dollard market (https://www.sportsmanagementdegreehub.com/fantasy-football-industry/)

The overarching goal of this class (from our perspective at least) is to teach us the tools and skills needed to make smarter and faster data-based decisions.  Whether this is looking at porfolio risk, stock tickers, or even football statistics these skill are certainly transferrable between various industries.  In fact, we would be willing to make the argument that fantasy sports could be grouped into the larger fintech sector.

Our team has built a machine learning model to evaluate key statistics of player over time, and build a strategy that can be released via a Amazon Lex bot to help users draft their team, set their line-up and deliver a positive ROI from their initial investment.
